Test 2: WalletHub Review posting
Answer/Solution: WalletHub.java

I have tried multiple registration with wallethub but wallethub does not send me email verification. Thats why I could not verify email. As a result my review does not get published or does not go under https://wallethub.com/profile/mhossain39/reviews . However, review was available in https://wallethub.com/profile/mhossain39/. This url I used to verify review was posted and to make assertTrue.
